# SME-Assignment Detailed Solution 

In the second part of the assignment, a significant challenge emerged due to a circular dependency between the `PlayerView` and `PlayerController` classes. Circular dependencies occur when two or more modules depend on each other, directly or indirectly, which can lead to compilation errors and make code maintenance difficult.

In this specific scenario, the `PlayerView` class needed access to the complete definition of the `PlayerController` class, and vice versa. However, including the header file of one class within the other's header file created a loop where each class attempted to access the complete definition of the other, resulting in a compilation error.

To resolve this issue, I employed a common technique known as forward declaration. Instead of including the entire header file of `PlayerController` within `PlayerView`, I simply declared the class name `PlayerController` using a forward declaration. This informed the compiler that `PlayerController` is a class without providing its complete definition, effectively breaking the circular dependency.

By removing the `#include PlayerController.h` statement from `PlayerView.h` and replacing it with a forward declaration of `PlayerController`, the code was able to compile successfully. This approach not only resolved the compilation error but also improved code maintainability by breaking the tight coupling between the two classes.

Overall, addressing circular dependencies is essential for ensuring code modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance in software development projects. By employing techniques like forward declaration, developers can effectively manage dependencies and build robust, flexible systems.

# Designing the Weapon System for a First Person Shooter Game

Welcome to the brainstorming session for designing the weapon system of our first-person shooter game! In this educational content, we'll delve into the architecture of the weapon system, discussing the classes, their responsibilities, and how they communicate with each other to create an immersive gaming experience.

## Classes in the Weapon System

### 1. Player Class
The `Player` class represents the main character in the game and interacts with the weapon system. Here's how it integrates with the system:

- **Attributes:**
  - `equippedPrimaryGuns`: Array storing two primary guns.
  - `equippedSecondaryGun`: Pointer to the secondary gun.
  - `currentAmmo`: Tracks the current ammo count.
  - `totalAmmo`: Total ammo available for all guns.
  
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Equip and switch between primary and secondary guns.
  - Fire the equipped weapon.
  - Manage ammo counts.

### 2. Weapon Class
The `Weapon` class encapsulates the properties and functionalities of a shooter weapon. Let's explore its characteristics:

- **Attributes:**
  - `ammo`: Current ammo count.
  - `magazineSize`: Maximum ammo capacity per magazine.
  - `fireRate`: Rate of fire.
  - `reloadTime`: Duration taken to reload the weapon.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Handle firing mechanism.
  - Manage ammo count and reloading.
  - Provide information about weapon attributes.

### 3. UI Class
The `UI` class is responsible for displaying relevant information about the equipped weapons on the heads-up display (HUD). It provides essential feedback to the player during gameplay:

- **Attributes:**
  - `equippedWeaponsHUD`: Array displaying equipped weapons.
  - `currentAmmoHUD`: Displays current ammo count.
  - `totalAmmoHUD`: Displays total ammo count.

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Update and render HUD elements.
  - Show currently equipped weapons.
  - Display current and total ammo counts.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our weapon system architecture comprises the `Player`, `Weapon`, and `UI` classes, each with distinct responsibilities to ensure smooth gameplay. The `Player` class manages weapon equipping and firing, the `Weapon` class handles weapon properties and functionalities, and the `UI` class provides visual feedback to the player through the heads-up display.

By following object-oriented programming principles and clearly defining the interactions between different components, we can create a robust and immersive weapon system for our first-person shooter game.

Let's continue refining and implementing this architecture to bring our game to life!
